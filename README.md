### Code Style
- Use single quotes for string literals, unless you are writing JSON.
    - Right:
        ```js
        var foo = 'bar';
        ```
    - Wrong:
        ```js
        var foo = "bar";
        ```

- Opening braces should go on the same line as the statement.
    - Right:
        ```js
        if (true) {
            console.log('winning');
        }
        ```
    - Wrong:
        ```js
        if (true)
        {
                console.log('losing');
        }
        ```

- Use meaningful and descriptive variable names to enhance code readability.
    - Right:
        ```js
        var userCount = 10;
        ```
    - Wrong:
        ```js
        var x = 10;
        ```
